I am a PhD student at the University of Edinburgh. My Supervisors are [Michael Wemyss][] and [Iain Gordon][]. I am a student member of the [Hodge institute][Hodge].

I am primarily interested in representation theory. In particular Lie theory and the geometry and combinatorics that is associated with it. See my [research](research) page for more info on some of the things I am thinking about.

I started at the University of Edinburgh in September 2012 after finishing my undergraduate degree at the University of Sydney.
