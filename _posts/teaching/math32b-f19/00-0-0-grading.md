Your final grade will be calculated using the maximum of the following two grading schemes. Your letter grade will then be determined by your rank in the class. Unless something very out of the ordinary occurs I expect to give approximately 20-30% A's and 55-65% A's and B's combined.

Option 1:

~~~
10% (6 best homework/quiz scores) +
40% (combined midterm scores) +
50% (final exam score)
= raw final grade
~~~

Option 2:

~~~
10% (6 best homework/quiz scores) +
30% (best midterm score) +
60% (final exam score)
= raw final grade
~~~

Effectively, this will mean that unless you score worse in the final than both midterms, your __lowest midterm score will be dropped__. This also means missing one midterm probably will not impact your grade in any serious way.
