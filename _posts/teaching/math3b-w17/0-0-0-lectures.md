Here I will indicate which sections of the textbook will be covered in each lecture and the relevant problems in each problem set. It is recommended that you read the textbook and think about some of the problems __before__ the lecture.

You will find links to the lecture notes and slides as they become available. They represent more or less what we covered in lectures but not exactly, depending on how many questions I got and if we ran out of time.

- [Lecture 1](lectures/lect1.pdf): Review and limits and differentiation. Questions 1-6 in PS1.
- Lecture 2: Read section 4.1. Questions 7-11 in PS1.
- Lecture 3: Read section 4.2. Questions 1-6 in PS2.
