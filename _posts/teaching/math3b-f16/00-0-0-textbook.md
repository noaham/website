[S. J. Schreiber, _Calculus for the Life Sciences_, Wiley][discount book]

This is the official textbook for the class and I will be following the material closely. We will __not__ be using WileyPlus so feel free to buy a used copy. A discounted copy of the book (with online access) can be purchased by students, [directly from Wiley][discount book]. Owning a copy of the textbook will be very helpful. I will post links to other sources here as time goes on.
