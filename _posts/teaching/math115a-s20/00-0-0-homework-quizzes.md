There will be a problem set assigned every week. These will not be collected however it is strongly recommended that you complete it.

In weeks 2, 6, 8, 10, a small number questions from the problem set will be assigned as homework and collected and graded. At the end of weeks 1,2,3,5,6,8,9 a short quiz will be conducted online (accommodations will be made for different timezones).
