Your final grade will be calculated using the maximum of the following two grading schemes.

Option 1:

~~~
30% (best 4 quiz scores) +
20% (homework scores) +
30% (combined midterm scores) +
20% (final exam score)
= raw final grade
~~~

Option 2:

~~~
30% (best 4 quiz scores) +
20% (homework scores) +
15% (best midterm score) +
35% (final exam score)
= raw final grade
~~~

<!-- Effectively, this will mean that unless you score worse in the final than both midterms, your __lowest midterm score will be dropped__. This also means missing one midterm probably will not impact your grade in any serious way. -->
