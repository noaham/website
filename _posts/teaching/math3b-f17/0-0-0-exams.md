__Cheatsheets:__ For each exam, students may bring a cheat sheet. Each student must prepare their own handwritten cheat sheet. For the midterms, the cheat sheet may consist of one side of half a standard (A4 or letter) sheet of paper (i.e. A5 or letter folded in half lengthways). For the final, the cheat sheet may consist of one side of a standard sheet of paper. Cheatsheets that do not meet these requirements will be confiscated at the beginning of the exam.

__Calculators:__ You may use a non-programmable, non-graphing calculator in exams. Calculators not meeting this specification will be confiscated.

__Study:__ Here I will post some practice exams which might aid your study.
