[Linear Algebra, by S. Friedberg, et al][book]

Owning a copy of the textbook will be very helpful and is recommended however you might not find it necessary. I will post links to other sources here as time goes on. Feel free to buy an old or used copy of the textbook, it wont be necessary to own any particular edition (just make sure you know which problems are the homework problems).
