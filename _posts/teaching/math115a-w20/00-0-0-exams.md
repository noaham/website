There will be two midterms and a final exam. Apart from the exceptions mentioned below, only writing equipment will be allowed in exams. Exams must be written in pen.

* __Midterm 1:__ 8-8:50am, Wednesday 29 January
* __Midterm 2:__ 8-8:50am, Wednesday 26 February
* __Final Exam:__ 11:30am-2:30pm, Tuesday 17 March

__Cheatsheets:__ For each exam, students may bring a cheat sheet. Each student must prepare their own handwritten cheat sheet. For the midterms, the cheat sheet may consist of one side of half a standard (A4 or letter) sheet of paper (i.e. A5 or letter folded in half lengthways). For the final, the cheat sheet may consist of one side of a standard sheet of paper. Cheatsheets that do not meet these requirements will be confiscated at the beginning of the exam.

__Calculators:__ You may use a non-programmable, non-graphing, non-calculus capable calculator in exams. Calculators not meeting this specification will be confiscated.
