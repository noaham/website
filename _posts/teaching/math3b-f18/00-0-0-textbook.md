[S. J. Schreiber, _Calculus for the Life Sciences_, Wiley][book]

Owning a copy of the textbook will be very helpful and is recommended however you might not find it necessary. I will post links to other sources here as time goes on. We will __not__ be using WileyPlus so feel free to buy an old or used copy of the textbook - any edition is fine.
