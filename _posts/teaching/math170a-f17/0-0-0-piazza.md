[Piazza][] is a question and answer style forum which we will be using for this class. 

You can ask questions, either as yourself or anonymously. I highly encourage you to also try answering others' questions. Teaching others is by far the most effective way to learn and solidify what you already know. The TAs and I will monitor the discussion and answer questions occasionally. 

Obviously homework questions and solutions should not be posted on Piazza. Offences will be treated as academic dishonesty/cheating.
