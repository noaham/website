Due to the fact that I am teaching two classes this quarter I would appreciate your help managing communication for the class.

Mathematical questions should be asked on CampusWire (see below). In addition you should make use of my, and the TA's, office hours. Administrative questions should in the first instance be directed to your TA. If your TA cannot resolve your query then you should contact me on CampusWire.

If you need to email me, the subject line __must__ include the string `math3b-w19`. If not, then there is a good chance your email will slip through the cracks and remain unanswered.
