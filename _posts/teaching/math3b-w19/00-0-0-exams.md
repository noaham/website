There will be two midterms and a final exam.

* __Midterm 1:__ 8-8:50am Monday, 28 January, 2019
* __Midterm 2:__ 8-8:50am Monday, 25 February, 2019
* __Final Exam:__ 3-6pm Monday, 18 March, 2019

__Cheatsheets:__ For each exam, students may bring a cheat sheet. Each student must prepare their own handwritten cheat sheet. For the midterms, the cheat sheet may consist of one side of half a standard (A4 or letter) sheet of paper (i.e. A5 or letter folded in half lengthways). For the final, the cheat sheet may consist of one side of a standard sheet of paper. Cheatsheets that do not meet these requirements will be confiscated at the beginning of the exam.

__Calculators:__ You may use a non-programmable, non-graphing and non-integration calculator in exams. Calculators not meeting this specification will be confiscated.

__Study:__ Here I will post some practice exams which might aid your study.
