### Glasgow, Thursday 4 Dec December 2014 ###

When:     | 4pm Thursday 4 December 2014
Where:    | Room 515, School of Mathematics, University of Glasgow.
Speakers: | Haris Stylianakis and Noah White (details of the talks are below)

**Haris Stylianakis**
*Congruence subgroups of braid groups.*

This talk will be based on the papers:

+ Coxeter, 1959, [*Factor groups of the braid group*][Coxeter1959]
+ Wajnryb, 1991, [*A braidlike presentation of $\mathrm{Sp}(n, p)$*][Wajnryb1991]

*Abstract/reading instructions:* We can consider the symmetric group as a quotient of the braid group over the normal closure of a braid generator squared. Consider the normal closure of a braid generator to the power of an arbitrary integer. Then, is the quotient finite? Coxeter in his paper "factor groups of braid groups" proved that the answer is not always positive. Are there finite index normal subgroups of braid groups, that include a normal closure of a braid generator to an arbitrary power? If so, what is the quotient group? Wajnryb in his paper "A braidlike presentation of $Sp(n, p)$" provided a presentation of the symplectic group over a finite field in terms of the braid group. This presentation allow us to study the normal subgroups of braid groups on which the quotient is the symplectic group. In this talk we will examine these normal subgroups, and we will provide a geometric interpretation in terms of elements of mapping class groups of surfaces.

It would be beneficial to read the definitions of the symplectic group and to know a nice presentation for braid groups. I would also suggest to look at the definition of "mapping class group". You can find these definitions in [Benson Farb and Dan Margalit's book][FMbook]:

+ Chapter 2: definition of mapping class group
+ Chapter 6: definition of symplectic group
+ Chapter 9: definition of braid group

*The representation theory of the symmetric groups via the action of a "maximal torus".*

This talk will be based on the paper:

+ Okounkov and Vershik, 1996, [*A new approach to representation theory of symmetric groups.*][OV1996]

*Abstract/reading instructions:* The representation theory of the Symmetric groups is a very old subject going back to work of Frobenius and Schur in the 19th century and then, importantly, taken up by Young at the turn of the century. Whilst the irreducible representations can be constructed, very little is known about them, even today. The classical approach is to reason that since a finite group must have an irreducible representation for every (p-regular) conjugacy class we should look for irreducible representations labelled by partitions. This approach, while effective, is somewhat artificial in the sense that it forces the combinatorics of partitions and tableaux upon us.

I will outline Okounkov and Vershik’s modern approach which gives the subject a Lie theoretic flavour and demonstrates the origin of the combinatorics and exactly how this controls the representation theory. Time permitting I will explain how this approach leads to a much better understanding of the representation theory (mod p) through categorification and how this has been applied to deduce results not known previously for the symmetric groups and many related algebras.

See pages 2 and 3 of [these notes](http://www.ma.rhul.ac.uk/~uvah099/Maths/SymComb.pdf) for the definition of the Specht modules. Try carrying out the construction for the partitions $(2), (1,1)$ (one dimensional representations of $ S\_2$) and $(2,1)$ (a two dimensional representation of $S\_3$). Now decompose the $S\_3$ rep $(2,1)$ as a direct sum of $S\_2$ reps.

### Edinburgh, Thursday 13 November 2014 ###

When:     | 4pm Thursday 13 November 2014
Where:    | 11.18 (level 11) David Hume Tower, University of Edinburgh
Speakers: | Ana Rovi and Joe Karmazyn (details of the talks are below)

**Ana Rovi**
*Differential forms on general commutative algebras.*

This talk will be based on the paper:

+ Rinehart, 1963, [*Differential forms on general commutative algebras.*][Rinehart1963]

*Abstract/reading instructions:* We will use some results in that paper to develop examples of Hopf algebra structures on the enveloping algebra of a certain generalisation of Lie algebras. We show that this construction shows interesting differences with respect to the classical case.

**Joe Karmazyn**
*Constructing moduli spaces of quiver representations.*

This talk will be based on the paper:

+ King, 1994, [*Moduli of Representations of finite-dimensional algebras*][King1994]

*Abstract/reading instructions:* Given a finite dimensional path algebra of a quiver with relations this paper constructs a variety that is the moduli space of certain representations of this quiver with relations. This associates various geometric spaces to these noncommutative algebras. The construction itself is very concrete, and I will try and give lots of examples.

Constructing this space as a (fine) moduli space is more powerful than just constructing it as a variety as it also produces an associated family of vector bundles. Time permitting, I will try and mention how this additional structure has been used to establish deeper links between these noncommutative algebras and geometry.

While I will recall all the required definitions it might be helpful to try and familiarise yourself with quivers in general and particularly with finite dimensional quiver representations. Finding all representations of the Kronecker quiver with dimension vector (1,1) up to isomorphism would be a helpful exercise.

### Glasgow, Thursday 23 October 2014 ###

When:     | 4pm Thursday 23 October 2014
Where:    | Room 516, School of Mathematics, University of Glasgow.
Speakers: | Chris Campbell and Paul Gilmartin (details of the talks are below)

**Chris Campbell:**  
*The Gerstenhaber Algebra Structure on Hochschild Cohomology for Koszul Algebras.*
  
This talk will be based on the papers:
  
+ Gerstenhaber, 1963, [*The Cohomology Structure of an Associative Ring.*][Gerstenhaber1963]
+ Gerstenhaber, 1964, [*On the Deformation of Rings and Algebras.*][Gerstenhaber1964]
  
*Abstract/reading instructions:* The first paper establishes a Gerstenhaber algebra structure on Hochschild cohomology and I will explain this, people may want to wikipedia this just to know what to expect. The paper is mostly technical lemmas establishing the necessary properties and can be fairly lightly skim read with that in mind. As for the second paper, I will concentrate on the first section, as this is the motivation for my research. I will mostly be discussing the definitions and giving them some slightly more modern context. This boils down to what a deformation is for an associative algebra, and how Hochschild cohomology is related to it. I won't assume anyone has read anything in these but it may make for a softer landing.

**Paul Gilmartin:**  
*Connected Hopf algebras of finite GK dimension.*

This talk will be based on the papers:

+ Zhung, 2012, [*Properties of pointed and connected Hopf algebras of finite GK dimension.*][Zhuang2012]
+ Wang, Zhang and Zhuang, 2013 [*Connected Hopf algebras of Gelfand-Kirillov dimension four*][WZZ2013]

*Abstract/reading instructions:* My talk will begin probably with the definition of a Hopf algebra (but it would probably be better if people knew this beforehand). I shall then proceed to (briefly) explain the meaning of “connected” and “finite GK dimension”, why they can be seen to be natural conditions to impose on Hopf algebras (from both a geometric and algebraic point of view) and then go on to look at a couple of  explicit and motivating examples of Hopf algebras satisfying these conditions.

With the background material covered, my next goal will be to discuss some of the results (without much mention of their proofs) proved by Wang, Zhang and Zhuang in the  first two of the aforementioned papers, which establish many nice ring-theoretic facts about these Hopf algebras. As time permits, I shall then talk about my own research, which has been to generalise the results of Wang, Zhang and Zhuang to “coideal subalgebras” of connected Hopf algebras.

I do not expect anyone to read any of the papers I’ve listed. What would be good is if people knew the definitions of a filtered ring and the associated graded ring of a filtered ring, but I’ll probably explain these things anyway. For certain parts of the talk it may also be useful to be vaguely familiar with Hilbert’s Nullstellensatz, although this probably won’t be essential.
