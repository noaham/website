*About the Gel'fand-Kirillov Conjecture*

This talk will be based on the paper:

+ Gel'fand and Kirillov, 1966, [*Sur les corps liés aux algèbres enveloppantes des algèbres de Lie.*][GK1966]

[GK1966]: http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=207918

*Abstract/reading instructions:* Classifying the objects of a given nature is one of the goals of algebra. When classifying rings one often tries first to classify them up to birational equivalence, i.e. to classify their (skew)-field of fractions. We present the 1966 paper of Gel'fand and Kirillov, where the authors study this question for enveloping algebras of Lie algebras. They conjectured that an enveloping skewfield (the skewfield of fractions of an enveloping algebra of a (certain) Lie algebra) is isomorphic to a Weyl skewfield, a rather simple skewfield. Moreover they solve the isomorphism problem for Weyl skewfields. We will also survey the development around their conjecture as well as we will present its quantum and Poisson versions.

Suggested topics for reading:
-non commutative localisation
-enveloping algebra of Lie algebra
-good example: think of U(sl2) and invert everything. Can you simplify the relations? Can you find generators x,y,z such that xy-yx=1 and z is central?

The first two topics will be briefly covered, they can be found in Noncommutative Noetherian Rings by McConnel and Robson.
