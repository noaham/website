### Glasgow, Friday 23 October 2014 ###

When:     | 4pm Friday 23 October 2014
Where:    | Room 516, School of Mathematics, University of Glasgow.
Speakers: | Chris Campbell and Paul Gilmartin (details of the talks are below)

+ **Chris Campbell:**  
  *The Gerstenhaber Algebra Structure on Hochschild Cohomology for Koszul Algebras.*
  
  This talk will be based on the papers:
  
  + Gerstenhaber, 1963, [*The Cohomology Structure of an Associative Ring.*][Gerstenhaber1963]
  + Gerstenhaber, 1964, [*On the Deformation of Rings and Algebras.*][Gerstenhaber1964]
  
  *Abstract/reading instructions:* The first paper establishes a Gerstenhaber algebra structure on Hochschild cohomology and I will explain this, people may want to wikipedia this just to know what to expect. The paper is mostly technical lemmas establishing the necessary properties and can be fairly lightly skim read with that in mind. As for the second paper, I will concentrate on the first section, as this is the motivation for my research. I will mostly be discussing the definitions and giving them some slightly more modern context. This boils down to what a deformation is for an associative algebra, and how Hochschild cohomology is related to it. I won't assume anyone has read anything in these but it may make for a softer landing.

+ **Paul Gilmartin:**  
  *Connected Hopf algebras of finite GK dimension.*

  This talk will be based on the papers:

  + Zhung, 2012, [*Properties of pointed and connected Hopf algebras of finite GK dimension.*][Zhuang2012]
  + Wang, Zhang and Zhuang, 2013 [*Connected Hopf algebras of Gelfand-Kirillov dimension four*][WZZ2013]

  *Abstract/reading instructions:* My talk will begin probably with the definition of a Hopf algebra (but it would probably be better if people knew this beforehand). I shall then proceed to (briefly) explain the meaning of “connected” and “finite GK dimension”, why they can be seen to be natural conditions to impose on Hopf algebras (from both a geometric and algebraic point of view) and then go on to look at a couple of  explicit and motivating examples of Hopf algebras satisfying these conditions.

  With the background material covered, my next goal will be to discuss some of the results (without much mention of their proofs) proved by Wang, Zhang and Zhuang in the  first two of the aforementioned papers, which establish many nice ring-theoretic facts about these Hopf algebras. As time permits, I shall then talk about my own research, which has been to generalise the results of Wang, Zhang and Zhuang to “coideal subalgebras” of connected Hopf algebras.

  I do not expect anyone to read any of the papers I’ve listed. What would be good is if people knew the definitions of a filtered ring and the associated graded ring of a filtered ring, but I’ll probably explain these things anyway. For certain parts of the talk it may also be useful to be vaguely familiar with Hilbert’s Nullstellensatz, although this probably won’t be essential.
