### Glasgow, 15 January 2016 ###

When:     | 3:45pm Friday 15 January 2016
Where:    | School of Mathematics, University of Glasgow.
Speakers: | Tomasz Przezdziecki and Simon Crawford (details of the talks are below)

**Tomasz Przezdziecki**
*KLR algebras and geometric representation theory*

This talk will be based on the paper:

+ Varagnolo and Vasserot 2011, [*Canonical bases and KLR-algebras*][VV2011]

[VV2011]: http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=2837011


*Abstract/reading instructions:* The main goal of the talk is to explain the geometric construction of KLR (quiver Hecke) algebras due to Vasserot & Varagnolo. These algebras were introduced by Khovanov & Lauda and Rouquier by combinatorial and algebraic means. Research on KLR algebras has been motivated by their role in the categorification of quantum groups and their connection to affine and cyclotomic Hecke algebras. We will briefly review classical geometric representation theory, recalling the Steinberg variety and the construction of the group algebra of a Weyl group in its homology. We will then sketch how to modify this construction to obtain a KLR algebra. The interesting new features include the use of quiver flag varieties and equivariant homology. 

**Simon Crawford**
*Deformations of Kleinian singularities and singularity categories*

This talk will be based on the papers:

+ Vinberg, 1995, [*On reductive algebraic semigroups*][V1995]
+ Rittatore, 2002, [*Very flat reductive monoids*][R2002]

[CBH1998]: http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=1620538
[H1993]: http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=1247356

*Abstract/reading instructions:* In 1998, Crawley-Boevey and Holland introduced a family of deformations of the coordinate rings of Kleinian singularities, which may be viewed as a generalisation of earlier work by Hodges. They also introduced the deformed preprojective algebra, and proved that their existed Morita equivalences and, under suitable hypotheses, isomorphisms between these two families of deformed algebras. This allowed them to deduce a number of nice ring theoretic and homological properties. I will give an overview of their results, with an emphasis on examples, and will also try to explain how their results have motivated my research.
