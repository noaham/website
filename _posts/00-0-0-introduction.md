The motivation for my research comes from representation theory. One can often make difficult questions in representation theory simpler by reinterpreting them in terms of some geometry. Often this sheds light on the underlying combinatorics. It is this interaction which I find fascinating.

1. A particularly beautiful example are the *Littlewood-Richardson coefficients*. On the combinatorial side, these numbers control the multiplication of Schur polynomials. On the algebraic side they are responsible for the decomposition of tensor products of simple $ \mathfrak{gl}\_n  $-modules. And on the geometric side they tell us how Schubert varieties intersect. This correspondence is at the heart of one of my lines of research. More specifically I am interested in the relationship between crystal bases, the Gaudin model and the algebraic Bethe ansatz for $\mathfrak{gl}_n$. 

2. Reflection groups, braid groups and their Hecke algebras are fundamental objects in the representation theory of finite groups of Lie type. I am interested in the relationship between the cactus group (a relative of the braid group) and the Kazhdan-Lusztig cells of the reflection group. In type A, this overlaps with the previous line of research. 

3. There are many interesting functions on the variety of matrices such as the determinant, trace, various minors, etc. The reflection equation algebra, related to the quantum group $U\_q(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$, is a quantisation of the variety of matrices and I am interested in understanding noncommutative analogues of classical facts.
