The **G**lasgow **E**dinburgh **A**lgebra **R**esearch **S**tudent seminar is aimed at postgraduates at Glasgow and Edinburgh Universities who use algebra in their work. We meet roughly three times per semester and speakers present an important paper in their area of research and explain how this relates to their own work.

The seminar is currently organised by [Chris Campbell][] and [Noah White][]. Get in touch if you have any questions.
