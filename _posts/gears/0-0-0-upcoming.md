### Glasgow, 30 March 2016 ###

When:     | 4pm Wednesday 30 March 2016
Where:    | Lecture theatre 507, Boyd Orr building, University of Glasgow.
Speakers: | Angela Tabiri (Glasgow), and  Gwendolyn Barnes (Heriot-Watt) (details of the talks are below)

*Please note the unusual location. The Boyd Orr Building is next to the Mathematics department*

**Angela Tabiri**
*Quantum homogeneous spaces*

This talk will be based on the papers:

+ Müller and Schneider 1999, [*Quantum homogeneous spaces with faithfully flat module structures*][MS1999]
+ Krähmer 2012, [*On the Hochschild (co)homology of quantum homogeneous spaces.*][K2012]

[MS1999]: http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=1710737
[K2012]: http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=2931396

*Abstract/reading instructions:* Quantum homogeneous spaces are Hopf algebras with additional properties. In this seminar, I will define and give an example of a quantum homogeneous space. Then I will end with some examples of planar curves which are quantum homogeneous spaces.


**Gwendolyn Barnes**
*The Quantum Group Revolution*

This talk will be based on the paper:

+ Aschieri, 2012, [*Twisting all the way: from algebras to morphisms and connections*][A2012]

[A2012]: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1210.1143v1.pdf

*Abstract/reading instructions:* The theory of connections on fiber bundles underlies our modern understanding of classical field theories such as gravity and Yang-Mills theory. Recent observations suggest that the corresponding quantum theories are noncommutative and nonassociative. An abstract notion of geometry is required in order to describe these quantum field theories in a manner that is compatible with the classical descriptions. In work together with Alexander Schenkel and Richard J. Szabo we have appealed to the tools of category theory and topos theory to better understand the mathematical structures underlying noncommutative and nonassociative deformations of spacetime geometry [arXiv:1601.07353, arXiv:1507.02792, arXiv:1409.6331].
