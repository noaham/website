I am a postdoc in the Department of Mathematics at the University of California, Los Angeles. Previously I was at the Max Plank Institute for Mathematics, Bonn and before that I was a phd student at the University of Edinburgh. My supervisers were [Michael Wemyss][] and [Iain Gordon][]. 

I am primarily interested in representation theory. In particular Lie theory and the geometry and combinatorics that is associated with it. See my [research](research) page for more info on some of the things I am thinking about.
