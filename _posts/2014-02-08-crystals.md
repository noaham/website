Fix a semisimple Lie algebra, $\mathfrak{g}$. For each integrable $U\_q(\mathfrak{g})$-representation there is a combinatorial object called a crystal. The crystal encodes a special basis of the module on which the action is especially nice.

It is well known that both the category of representations of $U\_q(\mathfrak{g})$, and the category of $\mathfrak{g}$-crystals is monoidal, that is it has a tensor product. In fact, the category $\mathtt{Rep} U\_q(\mathfrak{g})$ has the extra structure of a braiding. This means that we have natural isomorphisms $U \otimes V \cong V \otimes U$ in a way which give a representation of the braid group $B\_n$ on $U^{\otimes n}$.

This is a very nice structure but unfortuntely it doesn't quite descend to $\mathfrak{g}$-$\mathtt{Crystals}$. Instead something else is true, we have a coboundry structure. This is just like a braiding but instead of an action of the braid group we have an action of the "cactus group" $J\_n$. The cactus group, just like the braid group is an extension of the symmetric group, $S\_n$, and has generators

$$
s_{ij} \quad \text{ for } 1 \le i < j \le n \\
$$

and relations

$$
\begin{align}
s_{ij}^2 &= 1 \\
s_{ij}s_{kl} &= s_{kl}s_{ij} \quad \text{ if } [i,j] \cap [k,l] = \emptyset, \text{ and,} \\
s_{ij}s_{kl} &= s_{mn}s_{ij} \quad \text{ if } [i,j] \subset [k,l].
\end{align}
$$

If $\widehat{s}\_{ij}$ is the permutation *reversing* the interval $[i,j]$ then $m=\widehat{s}\_{ij}(l)$ and $n=\widehat{s}\_{ij}(k)$.
