Fix a semisimple Lie algebra, $\mathfrak{g}$. As is well known that both the category of representations of the associated quantum group, $U\_q(\mathfrak{g})$, and the category of $\mathfrak{g}$-crystals is monoidal, that is it has a tensor product. In fact, the category $\mathtt{Rep} U\_q(\mathfrak{g})$ has the extra structure of a braiding. This means that we have natural isomorphisms $U \otimes V \cong V \otimes U$ in a way which give a representation of the braid group $B\_n$ on $U^{\otimes n}$.

This is a very nice structure but unfortuntely it doesn't quite descend to $\mathfrak{g}$-$\mathtt{Crystals}$. Instead something else is true, we have a coboundry structure. This is just like a braiding but instead of an action of the braid group we have an action of the "cactus group" $J_n$.
