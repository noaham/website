The motivation for my research comes from representation theory. In particular I am interested in Lie algebras and related objects such as the Weyl groups. One can often make difficult questions in representation theory simpler by reinterpreting them in terms of some geometry. Often this sheds light on the underlying combinatorics. It is this interaction which I find fascinating.

A particularly beautiful example are the *Littlewood-Richardson coefficients*. On the combinatorial side, these numbers control the multiplication of Schur polynomials. On the algebraic side they are responsible for the decomposition of tensor products of simple $ \mathfrak{gl}\_n  $-modules. And on the geometric side they tell us how Schubert varieties intersect. This correspondence is at the heart of my research.

More specifically I am interested in the relationship between crystal bases, the Gaudin model and the algebraic Bethe ansatz for $\mathfrak{gl}_n$. 

I am also working on a project with [David Jordan][] on describing the center of the quantum group $U\_q(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$ combinatorially.
