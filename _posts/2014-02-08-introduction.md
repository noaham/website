The motivation for my research comes from representation theory. Many difficult questions in representation theory can be made simpler by reinterpreting them in terms of some geometry. Often this sheds light on the underlying combinatorics.

"Canonical" or "crystal" bases are combinatorial objects which summarize a great deal of information about the representation theory of Lie algebras. I am interested in investigating the connection between crystal bases and recent results about the Gaudin model and the algebraic Bethe ansatz.
