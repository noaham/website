From August 2020 I will be a member of the Mathematical Sciences Institute at the Australian National University. Previously I was a postdoc in the Department of Mathematics at the University of California, Los Angeles working with [Rapha&euml;l Rouquier][Raphael Rouquier]. Before that I was at the Max Plank Institute for Mathematics, Bonn after completing my phd at the University of Edinburgh. My supervisors were [Michael Wemyss][] and [Iain Gordon][]. 

I am primarily interested in representation theory. In particular Lie theory and the geometry and combinatorics that is associated with it. See my [research](research) page for more info on some of the things I am thinking about.

I am organising a representation theory conference in Los Angeles June 2020. Check back soon for details!
