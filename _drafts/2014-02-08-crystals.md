If $\mathfrak{g}$ is a semisimple Lie algebra then attached to each integrable $U\_q(\mathfrak{g})$-module there is a combinatorial object called a *crystal*. The crystal encodes a special basis of the module on which the action is especially nice, they capture a great deal of information about the module.

Both the category of representations of $U\_q(\mathfrak{g})$, and the category of $\mathfrak{g}$-crystals have a tensor product. In fact the category of $U\_q(\mathfrak{g})$-modules has the extra structure of a braiding. This means that we have natural isomorphisms $U \otimes V \cong V \otimes U$ in a way which gives a representation of the braid group $B\_n$ on $U^{\otimes n}$.

This is a very nice structure but unfortunately it doesn't quite descend to the category of crystals. Instead something else is true, we have a *coboundary* structure. This is just like a braiding but instead of an action of the braid group we have an action of the *cactus group* $J\_n$. The cactus group, just like the braid group is an extension of the symmetric group, $S\_n$.

and relations

$$
\begin{align}
s_{ij}^2 &= 1 \\
s_{ij}s_{kl} &= s_{kl}s_{ij} \quad \text{ if } [i,j] \cap [k,l] = \emptyset, \text{ and,} \\
s_{ij}s_{kl} &= s_{mn}s_{ij} \quad \text{ if } [i,j] \subset [k,l].
\end{align}
$$

Where $\widehat{s}\_{ij}$ is the permutation *reversing* the interval $[i,j]$ and $m=\widehat{s}\_{ij}(l)$ and $n=\widehat{s}\_{ij}(k)$.

The kernels of the homomorphisms from the $B\_n$ and $J\_n$ to $S\_n$ are respectively called the *pure braid group*, $PB\_n$, and the *pure cactus group*, $PJ\_n$.

Just like the pure braid group is the fundamental group of $X\_n = \mathbb{C}^n\backslash \left\\{  z\_i \neq z\_j \right\\}$, the pure cactus group is the fundamental group of an interesting space, the real points of the moduli space of stable, genus zero, $(n+1)$-pointed curves, $\overline{M}\_{0,n+1}(\mathbb{R})$. So attached to every $n$-fold tensor product of crystals, $B^{\otimes n}$, we get a representation of the fundamental group of this moduli space.
